# Word Memorization Game

I designed this simple command-line game to help my Spanish learning journey.

The game loads a list of Spanish words from a CSV file, with its English translation. The user has three attempts to guess the correct English translation. 

Currently, there is no scoring table, but I will add in the future updates.


You can clone the repository and whether play my game or add your oww CSV file and play it.

Ensure you have Python installed on your device. I built it with Python 3.
